Setup repo structure: /client (React), /server (Node/Express).

Configure MongoDB connection.

Setup ESLint/Prettier for clean code.

Install dependencies:

Backend: express, mongoose, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, cors, dotenv

Frontend: react, axios, react-router-dom, tailwind, recharts (charts)

Users can create a team, invite members (store invites, skip actual email if short on time).

Backend middleware: check team before serving data.

Frontend: Team dashboard page.

Day 5 – Dashboard UI

React Admin Dashboard

Day 6 – Roles & Permissions

Implement roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer.

Middleware on backend to check role before API access.

Frontend: Hide/disable buttons based on role.

Day 7 – Real-Time Updates

Add Socket.IO to backend + frontend.

Live updates → when someone adds data, others see immediately.

Example: “Team activity log” showing who added/edited something.

LangChain + OpenAI with Node

Day 13 – Deployment

Containerize backend with Docker.

Deploy backend on Render/Heroku.

Day 14 – Testing + Polish

Add Jest tests for backend APIs.

Add Cypress tests for frontend flows (login, dashboard, billing).

Write a solid README.md with screenshots + live demo link.

Record a short demo video (2–3 mins) for recruiters.
